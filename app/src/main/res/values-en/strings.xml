    <string name="surplus">To offer a more immersive gaming experience, it is possible to add a choice of characters on the home page. Once the user has made their choice, the information related to the selected character is stored in a variable. In the game, the character as well as the background are modified according to the choice made, for a more personalized gaming experience. The game consists of entering the correct answer to the displayed calculation. An animation for each character has been created during the waiting period, successful answer, or end of the timer. The timer returns to 30 seconds after each correct answer and stops at 0. It is possible to view the best score recorded on the device.</string>
